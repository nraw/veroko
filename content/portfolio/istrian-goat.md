The Istrian goat is culturally, maybe the most important animal of Istria. 
<!--more-->

The proof of its relevance is easily found on Coat of arms of Istria and Coat of arms of Croatia. Despite this fact, it is one of many endangered spieces and less than 100 live in Istria and surrounding areas today.

Its characteristics are: horns and beards in both males and females, white coloration of their fur and two wattles (or bells hanging from the throat area).
In the past it was valued for its milk.

The illustration was done for uni.
