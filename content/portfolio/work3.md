Beautiful Istrian cattle, BoÅ¡karin.
<!--more-->

Another indigenous animal of Istria, and endangered species as well. Its characteristics are: mostly white coloration of its fur, very soft ears (personal observation ğŸ™ˆğŸ™‰), big lyrelike horns. They weigh around 1300 kg and were primarly working animals. Nowdays, BoÅ¡karin is mostly valued for its meat.
